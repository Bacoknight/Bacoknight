Hi, I'm Kay (pronounced _[kai]_) - welcome to my personal GitHub ðŸ‘‹

[![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white&link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kajetantukendorf/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kajetantukendorf/) [![X Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-X/Twitter-black?style=flat&logo=X&logoColor=white&link=https://twitter.com/kaytukendorf)](https://twitter.com/kaytukendorf) 

I'm currently building [1Admin](https://www.1admin.io) and [Nix](https://www.nix.tech). I currently work at TikTok and have previously worked at McKinsey, PwC and King across a wide range of roles, but I'm always building something on the side!

A few of my favourite personal projects include:
- [Sam](http://wa.me/447547704035), a GPT companion available on WhatsApp.
- [AutoAR](http://autoar.app), a proof of concept using GPT to automate the Accounts Receivable process (i.e., chasing people who owe you money).
- [Twitch Encouragement Bot](https://github.com/Bacoknight/encouragement-twitch), an open-source bot that travels across Twitch and posts encouraging messages to different channels.
